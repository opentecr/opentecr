# opentecr

openTECR (Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions) is a database and a community.

We aim to create a reliable, free, machine-actionable data collection of apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with a clear change process to integrate new data and correct errors.

This database is expected to serve computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It will probably be used by eQuilibrator and COBRA as the shared data basis for their individual calculations.

## Communication

Our community organizes openly using a Google Groups: visit [https://groups.google.com/g/opentecr](https://groups.google.com/g/opentecr).

## Roadmap

[Have a look at the roadmap](roadmap.md) of this project to learn more about the next steps that we are going to take.

## Contribute

Write an email to opentecr@googlegroups.com if you want to know more about the community, just want to say hi, or share your thoughts.

Have a look at the [open concrete tasks](#concrete-tasks) if you want to contribute some of your energy to make openTECR work.

Come up with new ideas for openTECR or share your plans for using the data! You will find people genuinely interested, giving feedback and potentially even helping you to collaboratively achieve your goals in this community.

Use the [Issues function](https://github.com/opentecr/opentecr/issues) of this repository if you have a GitHub user account, or even send a much welcomed Pull Request to propose specific changes.

## Concrete tasks

* [Check whether there is literature of interest near to you!](./roadmap/missing_literature.md) If so, you can support openTECR by digitizing it.
* Curate recent literature, i.e. extract equilibrium constants, experimental conditions, etc. from provided literature references.
* Give feedback on this README and the other files / information you find about openTECR. What could be more clear? What confused you?

## Get in touch

When in doubt, just send an email opentecr@googlegroups.com -- we are happy to hear from you!
