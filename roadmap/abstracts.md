openTECR ("Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions") is a database and a community.

We create a data collection of apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, being reliable, open and machine-actionable, with a clear change process to integrate new data and correct errors. We believe that Open Science principles, and specifically Open Data and Open Source are key to achieving our vision.

The openTECR database serves computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It is used by eQuilibrator as the data basis for making predictions about any possible reaction.

Recently, we organized an open community curation effort (https://opentecr.github.io/invitation-to-curate). We prepared a curation workflow to analyze 278 pages of pages densely packed with tables and textual information. We invited volunteer contributions, and are immensely grateful about 17 volunteers investing almost 100 working hours.

At BOSC 2024, I would like to present our initiative and share our lessons learned about organizing successful community curation. I believe that our example can serve as a blueprint for other databases / project ideas which require a large amount of working hours.

We discovered that key to receiving contributions is to offer very small packages of work and a detailed curation manual. Our smallest task was 3 minutes long and well received.

Our small community (~40 members) shares a mailing list (https://w3id.org/opentecr) and a GitHub organization where we store our data and code under open licenses (https://github.com/opentecr/).

openTECR ("Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions") is a database and a community.

We aim to create a reliable, free, machine-actionable data collection of apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with a clear change process to integrate new data and correct errors.
This data can be used to integrate thermodynamic information onto biological pathway models. Simultaneously, the database also allows sharing of new experimental data.

So far, we aligned our small community (~20 members) on a common data model, and created a GitHub organization where we store our data and code (https://github.com/opentecr/). We collected so far a list of >40 publications that were not included in any previous databases. We are also in the process of re-curating the previous database (which is abandoned), which means that we collected over 1000 pdf files and the corresponding DOIs. The available data was double-checked in separate efforts, and this information is streamlined into our database, too.

The openTECR database is expected to serve computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It will probably be used by eQuilibrator and COBRA as the shared data basis for their individual calculations.

openTECR ("Open database on Thermodynamics of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions") is a database and a community. 

Bob Goldberg and colleagues have done a wonderful job in collecting data on equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions from the primary literature. Their work was published in a nice, human-readable form, in a series of reviews. It collects extensive evidence for measured data, with over 4500 data points from 1400 publications. 

We, however, usually pursue automated, computer-assisted interpretation and usage of this data. We therefore need a reliable, machine-actionable version of this database.

We organize ourselves openly using a Google Groups (https://groups.google.com/g/opentecr). So far, we aligned our small community (~20 members) on a common data model, and created a GitHub organization where we store our data and code (https://github.com/opentecr/); we collected so far a list of >40 publications that were not included in any previous databases. We want to integrate the previous database (which is abandoned) into ours in the near future, and work together on correcting errors in the existent data, curating additional details about the published equilibrium constants, and continuously integrating new data.

This database is expected to serve computational and experimental scientists in the fields of metabolic engineering, genome-scale metabolic modelling, biocatalysis and related fields by providing curated information. It will probably be used by eQuilibrator and COBRA as the shared data basis for their individual calculations.
