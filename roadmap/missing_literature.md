# Helping to collect literature

We did some research on the missing literature and were able to identify the whereabouts of most works. For some works, we are even missing this information.

You can help to make openTECR work by sending in primary literature of which we know about, but don't have access to. Or by identifying the whereabouts of the remaining pieces.

If you find any of this literature, please send an email to opentecr@googlegroups.com so we can organize the copyright-compliant way of storing it. Thank you so much in advance!


# Finding out how YOU can help

Regarding works with known whereabouts, you can help if:

1. you are entitled to free scans because of your institutional affilication
2. you are located near a library with the work and can spend time on digitizing it yourself
3. you have access to grants or any other money and can pay inter-library loan fees from it

For works with unknown whereabouts, you can help by
* doing research on where that work could be accessible from.


## Institutional affiliation

... IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology): 74MCK (free digitization for IIT staff, faculty, students)

If you are affiliated to one of the institutions above, you should be eligible for a free digitization of the works above.

If you know someone who is affiliated to those institutions and would help us in having the works scanned, that would be equally great!


## Location

I am based at

... Cambridge, UK: 52ASK

... France: 61PRA (available in: Marseille, Montpellier, Paris, Poitiers)

... Germany: 55DEC (available in: Goettingen, Hamburg, Jena, Kiel; Frankfurt, Leipzig; Erlangen, Frankfurt, Freiburg, Koeln, Muenchen, Muenster, Tuebingen, (Zuerich))

... IIT (Illinois Institute of Technology): 74MCK (free digitization for IIT staff, faculty, students)

... Oxford, UK: 68VEE


If you are located at one of the places above (or travel there), you could visit the library and scan the work. Beware: you probably have to request the work beforehand!

You can look up the reference code behind your location (e.g. you are in Cambridge, UK -> 52ASK) from the list above, and then more information about the reference from the list at the very bottom of this page.


## Access to money

I can easily pay fees for inter-library loans / scans:

* 55DEC (minimum 20€ for copy)
* 68VEE (24€ for scan, pay with IFLA vouchers)
* 74MCK ($45 for scan, pay via credit card)


You can spend money on inter-library loans / fees for literature, either through your library or from an account of yours (e.g. from one of your grants)? Then it would be great if you got in touch with us, so we can organize the procedure for scanning and delivery.

From the list above, you can see which literature could be scanned for a fee by the owning library. For some references, there also might exist other libraries which own the work and would scan it for a fee, if you would not be able to transfer the money / vouchers to the libraries above.


## Researching whereabouts

We didn't find any way to access the following works:

* 56KIT/HOR
* 65SEK/SUN
* 75KAP/BAR
* 84REK/RUM2 (appears in reference list of part 3)

If you can identify those pieces in any library catalog, please let us know by sending an email!

You can find all the info we have on those works in the list below. It proved often helpful to look for the journal by searching the catalog by the journal's ISSN.
